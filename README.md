### Hi there 👋 I'm Naomi!

👩‍💻 I am a bioinformatician in the NHS

👩‍🔬 I also have a PhD in rice developmental biology

🧬 Basically I really love omics data

I mostly code in Python 🐍, but I'm always open to new things.

## Currently working on...
## [gas-prices-app](https://github.com/Istaisa/gas-prices-app)

My friend Taylor has been tracking her gas (*petrol*) prices for years, and we're trying to make it easier for her by making there be an app for that.
I do not know how to make a mobile app and neither does she, so we make the perfect development team. Watch this space... 👀
